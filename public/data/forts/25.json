    "Tung Fort, also known as Kathingad, is a stunning conical hill fort located near Pawna Lake in Maharashtra. Its name 'Kathingad' literally means 'difficult fort,' owing to its steep and narrow ascent.",
    "Built during the Adil Shahi dynasty, Tung later came under the control of the Marathas. Despite its small size, it served as a watchtower fort due to its commanding view of the surrounding valleys and nearby forts like Lohagad, Tikona, and Visapur."
