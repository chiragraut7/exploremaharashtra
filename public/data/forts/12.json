    "Tikona Fort, also known as Vitandgad, is a beautiful hill fort located near Lonavala in Maharashtra. The name 'Tikona' comes from its triangular shape, and it stands as one of the most scenic trekking destinations in the Sahyadri mountain range.",
    "The fort dates back to the 15th century and played a key role in guarding the Maval region. It was later captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and served as an important watchtower fort due to its strategic location and commanding views of the surrounding valleys and lakes."
