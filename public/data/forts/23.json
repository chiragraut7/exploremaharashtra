    "Daulatabad Fort, also known as Devgiri Fort, is an architectural masterpiece located about 15 km from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Originally built in the 12th century by King Bhillama V of the Yadava dynasty, this fort later became one of the most powerful and impregnable strongholds in India.",
    "The fort is famous for its complex defense mechanisms, intricate design, and strategic hilltop location. It was briefly the capital of India during Muhammad bin Tughlaq’s reign when he renamed Devgiri to Daulatabad. Today, it stands as a magnificent reminder of medieval engineering and Maratha valor."
