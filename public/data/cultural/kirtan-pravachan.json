  "overview": [
    "Kirtan and Pravachan are integral parts of Maharashtra’s spiritual and cultural heritage, combining devotional music, storytelling, and moral teachings. These art forms have been practiced for centuries, spreading the philosophy of the Bhakti movement to common people.",
    "Kirtan involves devotional singing and rhythmic narration of stories from epics like the Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, and the life of saints, accompanied by instruments like harmonium, taal, and mridang. Pravachan, on the other hand, is a discourse where the speaker elaborates on scriptures and imparts moral and spiritual values."
