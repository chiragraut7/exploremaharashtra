    "The Jyotiba Temple, located near Wadi Ratnagiri in Kolhapur district, is one of Maharashtra’s most revered pilgrimage sites dedicated to Lord Jyotiba — an incarnation of Lord Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. It is believed that Lord Jyotiba helped Goddess Mahalaxmi in her battle against demons, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.",

    "During the Chaitra Poornima festival, the entire hill turns pink as devotees throw 'Gulal' (holy pink powder) as an offering to Lord Jyotiba, creating one of the most colorful and vibrant sights in Maharashtra."
