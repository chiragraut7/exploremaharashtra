    "The Saptashrungi Temple, located near Vani in Nashik district, is one of Maharashtra’s most venerated Shakti Peethas. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini — the seven-hill goddess — believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Durga.",
    "Perched on a hill surrounded by seven mountain peaks, the temple attracts lakhs of devotees every year, especially during Navratri and Chaitra Poornima. The idol of the goddess, carved from a rock and smeared with sindoor, is considered self-manifested (Swayambhu).",
    "According to legend, it was at this very site that Goddess Durga killed the demon Mahishasura, marking it as a symbol of divine strength and victory of good over evil."
